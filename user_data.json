            "Breakfast: Jolada Rotti with Peanut Chutney. A staple in Bagalkot, this dish consists of jowar (sorghum) flatbread served with spicy peanut chutney. The rotti is dry-roasted on a tava, while the chutney is made with roasted peanuts, garlic, and red chilies. Rich in fiber and protein, it provides sustained energy for the day.",
            "Lunch: Benne Dose with Sambar. A Bagalkot specialty, these crispy rice-lentil crepes are cooked in generous amounts of local butter (benne) and served with tangy sambar made with tur dal, tamarind, and local vegetables. The fermentation process enhances digestion, while the dish provides complex carbs and plant-based proteins.",
            "Dinner: Huggi (Karnataka-style Pongal). A comforting one-pot meal of rice and moong dal cooked with ghee, cumin, and black pepper. This Bagalkot version often includes local jaggery for subtle sweetness. Easy to digest yet nutritious, it provides complete proteins and is traditionally eaten for light evening meals."
